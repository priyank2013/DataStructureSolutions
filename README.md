# DataStructureSolutions
This is repository for project "Data structure and algorithm basics"

The main purpose of the repository is to share details regarding data structure and algorithm and help developer to learn more from tutorials, relevant competitive coding problems and solutions.

The folder hierarchy would be based on topics and sub topics. For exaple, Min cut algorithm would be having hierarchy : algorithm-> graphTheory -> minCut.

The project is open for everyone to share their knowledge.
